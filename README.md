# New Feature: The Geometric Color Anchor

**This github page contains many gif and png images, and it is a better choice to wait your browser before reading it.**

To introduce this feature, let's begin with a kimono sketch of Shiki. The sketch is from google image.

The new tool, color anchor, enable you to control the color of your painting with great stability. In most cases, you can use this tool to control the global color of the painting. **In most cases, casting the color anchors should be your first step.**

After this step, you should get a color draft like this:

Then, after you finishing your color draft, you should shift to your **Accurate Point** tool.

Then, you add hint colors and get the final result, like this:

Here is a gif version of the process:

In the same way, you can get many Shiki with different color, such as:

After reading these, you may ask: 

*"Oh, you are just good at color selection! But I am blind to these color and I have never learnt to painting! How can I select right color?"*

Ok, here we present a best-practice color list for you:

# New Feature: The Controlable Shading
